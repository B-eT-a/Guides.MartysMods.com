# Finding your Game's Proper Executable:
Unfortunately, every system is different, with varrying thoughts from different users.

With that in mind, each install of ReShade can be vastly different, and the ReShade Installer can behave differently depending on user's settings / game installs.

If you are struggling on finding a game's executable, this is a definitive guide showing you how to find the installs of the game the easiest.

## Global

### Step 1.
Open your game and Window's Task Manager.

{: .note}
You can open Task Manager in various ways.<br>
    1. Right click the Taskbar in Windows, and then click Task Manager
    2. Control + Alt + Delete all pressed at the same time, and then click Task Manager
    3. Control + Shift + Escape all pressed at the same time.

### Step 2.
While your game is still open, Alt+Tab over to Task Manager.<br>
In the Processes list, you should be able to see your game.<br>
    1. Right click your game in Task Manager's Processes tab
    2. Click `Go to details...`
    3. Right click the selected executable application that is now in your Details tab.
    4. Click `Open file location`
If Step 2. is done correctly, you should see your game's application highlighted in File Explorer.

In this area, you can note the location of the application you are looking for, as well as the specific game executable itself.
